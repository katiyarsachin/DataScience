Projects done on Machine Learning and Deep Learning using different ML/DL algorithms

Collection of projects done on mostly all machine learning algorithms for both regression and classification type problems.
Deep learing is one of my favourite part. Currently doing research on driver distraction detection problem using deep learing 
and will use computer vision to make my model more robust in real world.
