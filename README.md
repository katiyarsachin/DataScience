Projects done on Machine Learning and Deep Learning using different ML/DL algorithms

Collection of projects done on mostly all machine learning algorithms for both regression and classification type problems.
Deep learning is one of my favourite part. Presenting the master's research on driver distraction detection problem using deep learing 
and computer vision to make model more robust in real world.
